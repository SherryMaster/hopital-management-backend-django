# Contributing to Hospital Management API

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Hospital Management API as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-management-api.git
   cd hospital-management-api
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv hospital_env
   source hospital_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: hospital_env\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)

### Django Best Practices
- Use Django's built-in features when possible
- Follow Django naming conventions
- Use proper model relationships
- Implement proper error handling

### API Design

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

python manage.py test patients

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use Django's TestCase for database-related tests
- Use factory_boy for test data generation

### Test Structure
```
